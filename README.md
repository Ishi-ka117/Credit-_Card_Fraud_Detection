# Credit-_Card_Fraud_Detection
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both financial institutions and cardholders.This project employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and machine learning to gain insights into the dataset, understand patterns, and build an effective fraud detection model.
# Objective
1. To implement Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Machine Learning Model Implementation
3. Model Evaluation for Accuracy Enhancement
# Methodology
1. Data Collection:Collect credit card transaction details from Kaggle for analysis and organise in csv file.
2. Data Preprocessing:With the help of Exploratory Data Analysis handle the dataset,missing values and cleaning of the data.
3. Data Visualization: Utilize data visualization techniques to assess whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced. Identify Patterns trends in the data that may indicate fraudulent or legitimate transactions.
4. Dataset Splitting:: Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set
for model development and evaluation.
5. Model Development:Create a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn for binary classification, well-suited for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
6. Model Evaluation:Plot curves and evaluate model's performance using metrics like
Precision,Recall and F1 score.

# Contents of this Notebook
1. Data analysis of legit and fraud cases.
2. Correlation between different features or variables in the dataset.
3. Analyzing the density plots can provide insights into which features may be more informative for distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
4. Logistic model for binary classification of dataset.
5. Density plot for visualising Residual Errors between train and test data.
6. Evaluation of models using metrics like Precision,recall and F1 score with their plots.
